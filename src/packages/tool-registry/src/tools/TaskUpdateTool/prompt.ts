export const PROMPT = `Use this tool to update a task in the task list.

## When to Use This Tool

**Mark tasks as resolved:**
- When you have completed the work described in a task
- When a task is no longer needed or has been superseded
- IMPORTANT: Always mark your assigned tasks as resolved when you finish them
- After resolving, call TaskList to find your next task

- ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
- If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
- When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
- Never mark a task as completed if:
  - Tests are failing
  - Implementation is partial
  - You encountered unresolved errors
  - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

**Delete tasks:**
- When a task is no longer relevant or was created in error
- Setting status to \`deleted\` permanently removes the task

**Update task details:**
- When requirements change or become clearer
- When establishing dependencies between tasks

## Fields You Can Update

- **status**: The task status (see Status Workflow below)
- **subject**: Change the task title (imperative form, e.g., "Run tests")
- **description**: Change the task description
- **activeForm**: Present continuous form shown in spinner when in_progress (e.g., "Running tests")
- **owner**: Change the task owner (agent name)
- **metadata**: Merge metadata keys into the task (set a key to null to delete it)
- **addBlockedBy**: Mark tasks that must complete before this one can start. The dependency graph is bipartite — to express the inverse ("this task blocks B"), call TaskUpdate on B with \`addBlockedBy: [thisTaskId]\`. Adding a cycle (A → B → A, or self-loop) is rejected with TaskCycleError.

## Status Workflow

Status progresses: \`pending\` → \`in_progress\` → \`completed\`

Use \`deleted\` to permanently remove a task.

## Cascade unblock on completion

When you transition a task to \`completed\`, every other task whose \`blockedBy\` referenced it has that ID scrubbed automatically. Tasks that become fully unblocked (empty \`blockedBy\`) trigger a \`task_unblocked\` mailbox message to every idle teammate who owns an open task, so they wake up and re-check the task list.

The cascade outcome is reflected in the tool result you (the caller) see synchronously — \`Cascade unblock: ... freed N dependent task(s): #X, #Y. Notified M idle owner(s) (...)\`. You will NOT receive a \`task_unblocked\` attachment for cascades you triggered yourself; the result string is the signal. Workers (idle teammates) get the mailbox message because they are the ones who need to wake up.

If \`Notified 0 idle owner(s)\`, the unblocked tasks sit pending until someone claims them — typical when there are no live workers, or all current workers are busy with other tasks.

## Staleness

Make sure to read a task's latest state using \`TaskGet\` before updating it.

## Examples

Mark task as in progress when starting work:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "status": "in_progress"}
\`\`\`

Mark task as completed after finishing work:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "status": "completed"}
\`\`\`

Delete a task:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "status": "deleted"}
\`\`\`

Claim a task by setting owner:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "1", "owner": "my-name"}
\`\`\`

Set up task dependencies:
\`\`\`json
{"taskId": "2", "addBlockedBy": ["1"]}
\`\`\`
