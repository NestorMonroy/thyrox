/**
 * REPL ←-arrow → FleetView bridge. Port of ant 2.1.150 `o14` (5279.js) +
 * `l14` (5278.js).
 *
 * Flow (ant o14):
 *   1. derive a seed from the current REPL messages
 *   2. pre-seed the job's state.json so the FleetView row appears at once
 *      (empty intent → "send a prompt to start")
 *   3. dispatch a daemon-managed PTY worker (fire-and-forget) for the job
 *   4. mark hasUsedAgentsFleet (keeps the footer hint sticky)
 *   5. in-process: unmount the REPL Ink root, focus the new row via
 *      CLAUDE_AGENTS_SELECT, and hand control to the FleetView mount loop
 *
 * The unmount (step 5) → FleetView createRoot is exactly the
 * mount→unmount→remount stdin cycle that broke the original port; the
 * native stdin reader (stdin-napi) survives it, which is why this bridge
 * is now viable. See memory: project_ant_2150_leftarrow_bridge_source.
 *
 * Divergence from ant: rather than re-implementing ant `l14`'s bespoke
 * createRoot loop, ccb reuses `agentsFleetHandler` — the same self-contained
 * FleetView mount loop that backs `ccb agents` (spare pool + dispatch +
 * attach already wired). CLAUDE_AGENTS_SELECT seeds the focused row.
