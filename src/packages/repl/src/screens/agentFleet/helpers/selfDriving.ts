/**
 * Row "self-driving" predicate.
 *
 * A row is self-driving when ant has reason to believe it will keep
 * making progress without human input — currently:
 *   - has a routine attached (background routine driving it)
 *   - has `inFlight.kinds` including `"session_cron"` (cron timer mid-tick)
 *   - is a `/loop` job (detected by intent prefix)
 *
 * Source: ant yZ6 (5092.js:596-597) + WR_ (5092.js:592-594).
 *
 * Self-driving rows skip the "review" classification even if their
 * children have unresolved PR checks (PZ6:186-194).
