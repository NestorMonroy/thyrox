/**
 * Start the rendezvous (control) server inside a bg-worker REPL.
 *
 * This is the inner-REPL half of the rv channel (ant 4291.js). It runs
 * ONLY in a bg worker that was spawned with `CLAUDE_BG_RENDEZVOUS_SOCK`
 * set (spawnPty.ts) — i.e. the daemon-supervised PTY path. The server
 * gives the worker an out-of-band channel to its supervisor that ccb
 * previously lacked:
 *
 *   - An UNCONDITIONAL 30s heartbeat. This is the real gap ccb had: the
 *     PTY-ctrl heartbeat (ptyHost.ts) only fires when a client is attached
 *     (`clients.size > 0`), so an UNATTACHED bg worker sent no liveness
 *     signal at all and the supervisor's stall watchdog ran on pid-poll
 *     alone. The rv heartbeat fires regardless of attach state.
 *   - A startup-wedge watchdog: a worker that boots but never starts its
 *     first turn (blocked on a setup/onboarding dialog the supervisor
 *     can't see) is surfaced as `blocked` instead of sitting silently.
 *     Disarmed here the moment the first turn begins.
 *
 * The authoritative `state` / `done` pushes are fired from
 * useBgFleetStateSync (which already owns the state.json writes) so the
 * two hooks don't double-write disk — see that file's sendRv calls.
 *
 * Gated on `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_KIND === 'bg'` AND the rv socket env. The
 * server itself no-ops if the env var is unset, but we also gate here to
 * avoid importing the rv module in the foreground REPL hot path.
