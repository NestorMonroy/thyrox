/**
 * Keep the REPL's `localCommands` state fresh across every trigger that can
 * change the canonical `getCommands(cwd)` result:
 *
 * 1. Skill file changes (watcher) — full cache clear + disk re-scan, since
 *    skill content changed on disk.
 * 2. GrowthBook init/refresh — memo-only clear, since only `isEnabled()`
 *    predicates may have changed. Handles commands like /btw whose gate
 *    reads a flag that isn't in the disk cache yet on first session after
 *    a flag rename: getCommands() runs before GB init (main.tsx:2855 vs
 *    showSetupScreens at :3106), so the memoized list is baked with the
 *    default. Once init populates remoteEvalFeatureValues, re-filter.
 * 3. Plugin lifecycle — `/reload-plugins` and the install/uninstall paths
 *    call `refreshActivePlugins`, which clears every plugin/command cache
 *    and pushes a new `plugins.commands` array into AppState. The REPL
 *    holds the post-merge command list in `localCommands` (so MCP+plugin
 *    commands flow through `useMergedCommands`), and that state was
 *    previously only re-derived by triggers (1) and (2). Without this
 *    third subscription, an uninstalled plugin's commands stayed in the
 *    typeahead popup (and the executable command list) until session
 *    restart.
 *
 * `pluginCommandsRef` is the AppState mirror of `plugins.commands` from
 * `refreshActivePlugins`. We use its identity (not contents) as the
 * dependency — refresh always allocates a new array, so a !== compare is
 * cheap and avoids deep equality. The first effect run on mount re-fetches
 * the same array `initialCommands` was derived from, so it's effectively a
 * no-op (cleared-then-warmed loadAllCommands memo).
