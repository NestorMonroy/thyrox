/**
 * All lessons in display order. Each lesson lives in its own file under
 * this directory; adding a new lesson means adding the import + array entry
 * here. Order matters for the picker default focus and for the LogoV2
 * banner's `(X/N)` denominator (denominator is the live array length, so
 * the banner stays correct as lessons land).
 *
 * The full 10-lesson set is documented in
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-powerup-design.md` §3.
