// `X = ElH(1, RyH)` is the worktree creator behind a concurrency-1 semaphore.

// ccb reuses the swarm worktree subsystem (createAgentWorktree / hasWorktree
// Changes / removeAgentWorktree) — the same primitives AgentTool uses for its
// own isolation — so behavior matches a normal isolated subagent.
